# Statistical Analysis of Real-time PCR Data


## Overview
Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a broadly used technique in the biomedical research. Currently, few different analysis models are used to determine the quality of data and to quantify the mRNA level across the experimental conditions.


## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

- Implement methods for quality assessment, analysis and testing qPCR data for statistical significance. 

-  Understand Double Delta CT and standard curve models were implemented to quantify the relative expression of target genes from CT in standard qPCR control-group experiments

- Calculation of amplification efficiency and curves from serial dilution qPCR experiments are used to assess the quality of the data. 

- Two-group testing and linear models were used to test for significance of the difference in expression control groups and conditions of interest.
